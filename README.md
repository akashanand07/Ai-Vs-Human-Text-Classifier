Capstone Project â€“ AI vs Human Writing Detection  
*A Hugging Face Space by [Akash Anand](https://huggingface.co/akashananddd)*  

## ðŸš€ Project Overview  
This capstone project demonstrates an *AI vs Human Writing Detection System, designed to identify whether a piece of text is generated by an **AI language model* or written by a *human*.  
It showcases the full pipeline â€” from *data collection and model training* to *deployment and user interaction* through a *Gradio interface* hosted on *Hugging Face Spaces*.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features  
âœ… Accepts user input text (essay, paragraph, post, etc.)  
âœ… Predicts whether the text is *AI-generated* or *Human-written*  
âœ… Displays a *confidence score* for each prediction  
âœ… Easy-to-use *Gradio web interface*  
âœ… Fully deployable and open-source

## ðŸ§  Motivation  
With the rise of generative AI (like ChatGPT and similar models), it has become increasingly difficult to differentiate between human and AI-generated content.  
This project explores practical techniques for *AI text detection* â€” helping educators, researchers, and developers ensure content authenticity.
